# CA1D
#### A One-Dimensional Cellular Automaton made in Rust

---

### How to Use:
Install the Release Executable file and run it *from terminal*.
Run for help:
```
ca1d -h
```
You can also put it in the cargo/bin directory to run it from anywhere. (cargo/bin directory path must be there in the 
environment variables)
Usage:
```
ca1d <columns> <simulationsteps> <initgrid> <rule>
```

If you arent sure about how to make a rule. Run:
```
ca1d makerule
```
This will make you go through every possible neighbour combination (7) and then
define what the current cell should be in the next step.

## Thank you for using!
